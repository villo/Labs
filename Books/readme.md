Books for Enyo 2
================

About
-----

Books aims to replicate the Pane kind found in Enyo 1. Books create a collection of "Pages", with given page numbers and names that you can move between.

How to Use
----------

Books works very similar to Panes. First, you create your Books container:

	{kind: "Book"}

Now you can add anything into the components block:

	{kind: "Book", components: [
	    {name: "pageOne", content: "Hello"},
	    {name: "pageTwo", content: "Oh, why you changed the page!"}
	]}
	
The first component in the components block is visible when the book loads. You can change the visible book using the pageName method: 

	this.$.book.pageName("pageTwo");

Additionally, you can use the pageNumber method to change pages:
	
	this.$.book.pageNumber(2);

Books also supports lazy pages:

	{name: "somePage", kind: "thePageContent", lazy: true}

If you wish to load a lazy page, you must use the pageName function, pageNumber will not work.

Properties
----------

You can alter the functionality of Books by using certain properties when referencing the kind.

- The "transition" property lets you define what animation you wish to use when pages are changing. Currently, the transitions "fade", "pop", and "simple" are supported. Fade is used by default.
- The "cue" property will prevent animations from occuring concurrently, and run them once the current animation is completed. This is disabled by default.
- The "absolute" property changes how the pages are displayed. By default, all pages are given a "position: absolute;" style to allow animations to work correctly. Setting "absolute" to false will remove this styling, and set the transition to "simple".

Here's an example of some properties in action:

	{kind: "Book", cue: true, transition: "pop"}

Methods
-------
	
- pageName(string) - Changes the visible page to the given page name.
- pageNumber(number) - Changes the visible page to the given page number. 
- back() - Moves back to the previously viewed page.
- next() - Moves forward in the page stack. Will work after the "back" method is called.

Helpful Snippets
-------

In your "Page" kind, you can use this code to signal an "activate" event for that page.
	
	showingChanged: function(previousValue) {
		this.inherited(arguments);

		if(this.getShowing() && previousValue !== undefined){
			//ACTIVATED
			console.log("activated");
		}
	}

Known Issues
------------

- The "back" method will not move back to the page viewed when the Book loads.
- The "pageNumber" method can break with lazy pages. The numbering system doesn't work as expectected.
